# malaria-in-africa

## Overview

Welcome to the Malaria-In-Africa project! This GitHub repository contains code and data for conducting an in-depth analysis of malaria incidence in Africa. The goal of this project is to explore and understand the demographic patterns of malaria cases in different African regions and develop predictive models to anticipate its spread.

## Introduction

Malaria continues to be a significant public health issue in Africa, affecting millions of people each year. The Malaria-In-Africa project aims to analyze and visualize the patterns of malaria incidence across different African countries and regions. Additionally, it seeks to build predictive models that can forecast the future spread of malaria based on demographic and environmental factors.

## Data

The data used in this project comes from reputable sources such as the World Bank and UNICEF. These organizations provide valuable data related to malaria incidence, demographic information, climate data, and other relevant factors in various African countries.

## Analysis

The analysis phase of this project involves exploring the collected data to gain insights into the demographic factors that influence malaria incidence in Africa. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be used to identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations between variables.

## Predictive Modelling

Building on the insights gained from the analysis, predictive models will be developed using machine learning algorithms. These models will aim to forecast malaria incidence in specific regions based on various features like population density, climate conditions, and historical malaria rates.

## Usage

To use the code and replicate the analysis or predictive models, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Malaria-In-Africa.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Malaria-In-Africa`.
3. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Execute the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to reproduce the analysis and modelling steps.
